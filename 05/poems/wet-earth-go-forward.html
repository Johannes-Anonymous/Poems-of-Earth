            <pre id="content">Damp feet on wet earth,
as the wind soaks the trees;
the moonlight's been a stranger
since you've gotten off your knees.

So draw in cold breath,
remember when it was you began to see:
when you were aching, seeking,
digging into grace with skinned knees.

So enter again,
past wondrous sunrise warmth;
you must open your eyes, fully,
to see the stars in the dark.

Fear not strange suffering,
for only through such can you know:
the gold that loss and leaving bring,
the good weight of a purified soul.
