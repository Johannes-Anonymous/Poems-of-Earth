            <pre id="content">Before these bones
    fall asleep,
will he call on me?

A nervous child,
    spread fingers raised,
will I be found worthy?


The smoky, glassy heart
    has been shattered,
    which together we bore underneath
        photographs, in memory come to life;
    in last days
        we trembled forward,
    breathing in black and white.

Now I wait, and wander
    for roads I haven't seen,
while cold comes steadily upward
    from open ground
        â€” I musn't fall asleep.

Time, leading ever westward, leaves behind
    what I don't seem to need:
my father's shadow, like his pocketwatch,
    is now mine for keeps.

So winter breath, and hymn of earth:
    my chest stock-full of grief;
good wishes, the future we shared
    in plans, just intention-deep;
a holy hope, a righteous home,
    a true wife: we both believed.
