            <pre id="content">When the woodlands have kept their leaves
and quickly lost their color,
When your voice echoes back clear
    and without joy,
When your days are filled
    with a vibrant exchange of gifts
and you yet feel life winding
    down inside your chest;

Remember
    to set aside pleasures;
    to feel the solid dirt below you
        which will accept you;
    to wait for Him, immediately;
    to stand with calloused hands
        unclenched.

When the sun rises
    through your morning window,
will you open it
    and let your dreams go
    into the hands of your creator?
