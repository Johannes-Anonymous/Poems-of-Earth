            <pre id="content">Today I am sheltered by snow.

I wait, pressed against window
    to know of the cold,
and yearn stiffly,
    my heart taut
    against hope for you.

Do you remember my dreams?
Do our shared nights bear weight
    in your soul?

I often walk through flowering fields,
    gathering sweetest lilies;
but all of good earth and hearth
    turns soon to dust,
    carried away by wind.
