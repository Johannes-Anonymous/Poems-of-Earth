        <pre id="content">Wind-caressed and snowswept;
spoken in wonder, your name awakens hunger
in the caverns of my chest.

I am wandering, stuck-bent homebound,
gently aching south now,
feeling tug of memories anchored in warmer days.

With my fiddle-neck rent, and heartstrings bent in wreck,
desires within my skin burn, and
I am yearning for repair.

Your face my fiery center seeks
as I shuffle snow with slow, plodding feet.
I keep my head turned sideways.

Every lawn white with sun-dappled space,
every door like a portal of grace,
draws me a rough sketch of your upcoming abode.

Upon sight I'll know your home,
so I'm bracing for the unveiling of this unknown:

if my hopes — warm, steady, unseen like covered bones —
will be met when spoken;
or if the real luster I perceive,
a glowing edge that gives me to dream,
is only a dead trick — empty and cold —
a mere taunt of fool's gold.
