        <pre id="content">Growing older, I've awoken
    to hot terrors all around,
and the bright grace
I knew when younger
    is less easily found.

I've learned:
the realm of my heart
    is treacherous ground;
it has become a battlefield
    of aches,
    sunken bullets,
    and bones,
covered with half-light dust,
    the decay of my soul.

I've learned:
every idol dies,
    and we cling
    to their bleach-white bones.



So now,
    woman,
I pant with tortured lung,
feeling wounds I've borne long
    and no longer want;
I begin to rest starving eyes
and turn my toes back to you,
    to ask:

If I peel away my dying shirt
    and the sweat stays
    like stubborn waste;
if I am speckled brown
    with muddy earth,
    with soil stamped in my face;
if I come again
    (but cold and broken-limbed,)
    will you still remember
        and care
    to bear my name?
